The Global Carbon Project's fossil CO2 emissions dataset,5569235,"<p>The <a href=""https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/"">Global Carbon Project</a> (GCP) has been publishing estimates of global and national fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions since 2001. In the first instance these were simple republications of data from another source, but over subsequent years refinements have been made in response to feedback and identification of inaccuracies. In this article we describe the history of this process leading up to the methodology used in the 2021 release of the GCP&rsquo;s fossil CO<sub>2</sub> dataset.</p>  <p>The fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions dataset is included in both its standard, absolute form, and per capita, with associated metadata files in JSON format. A file indicating the source(s) of each data point is also provided (this is a work in progress).</p>",Global Carbon Budget 2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-4811-2022,1565,pdfs/Global_Carbon_Budget_2022.pdf

The FluPRINT database,3222451,"<p><strong>What is the FluPRINT database?</strong></p>  <p>The FluPRINT represents fully integrated and normalized immunology measurements from eight clinical studies taken from 740 individuals undergoing influenza vaccination with inactivated or live attenuated seasonal influenza vaccines from 2007 to 2015 at the Stanford Human Immune Monitoring Center.</p>  <p>The FluPRINT dataset contains information on more than 3,000 parameters measured using mass cytometry, flow cytometry, phosphorylation-specific cytometry, multiplex cytokine assays, clinical lab tests (hormones and complete blood count), serological profiling and virological tests. In the dataset, vaccine protection is measured using a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, and following FDA guidelines individuals are marked as high or low responders depending on the HAI antibody titers after vaccination.</p>  <p><strong>Want to know more?</strong></p>  <p>To understand how the FluPRINT dataset was generated and validated, and how to use it, please refer to our open-access paper published in Scientific Data journal:</p>  <p>Tomic, A., Tomic, I., Dekker, C.L. <em>et al.</em> The FluPRINT dataset, a multidimensional analysis of the influenza vaccine imprint on the immune system. <em>Sci Data</em> <strong>6, </strong>214 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0213-4</p>  <p>For additional exploration, please check out the project&rsquo;s website: <a href=""www.fluprint.com"">www.fluprint.com</a>, where you can also explore the FluPRINT dataset on the following link: <a href=""https://fluprint.com/#/database-access"">https://fluprint.com/#/database-access</a>.</p>  <p>If you want to host your own FluPRINT database, please follow our instructions provided on the Github repository: <a href=""https://github.com/LogIN-/fluprint"">https://github.com/LogIN-/fluprint</a>.</p>  <p><strong>How to use FluPRINT?</strong></p>  <p>Here, you can download the entire FluPRINT database export as an SQL file, or as a CSV file. Additionally, we included the file with the SQL query to obtain those files.</p>  <p>Files are provided in two formats: zip and 7zip (7z). 7zip is a free and open-source file archiver available for download here: <a href=""https://www.7-zip.org"">https://www.7-zip.org</a>.</p>  <p>In the FluPRINT database, there are 4 tables:<strong> <em>donor, donor_visits, experimental_data, </em></strong>and<strong><em> medical_history</em></strong><em>.</em><br> The exact description of each table is available in <a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/564062v1"">the FluPRINT paper</a>.</p>  <p>Briefly, in the table<strong> <em>donor</em></strong>, each row represents an individual with information about the clinical study in which an individual was enrolled (study ID and study internal ID), gender, and race. The second table, named <strong><em>donor_visits </em></strong>describes information about the donor&rsquo;s age, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, Body Mass Index (BMI), and vaccine received on each clinical visit. Information about vaccine outcome is available as geometric mean titers (geo_mean), the difference in the geometric mean titers before and after vaccination (delta_geo_mean), and the difference for each vaccine strain (delta_single). In the last field, each individual is classified as a high and low responder (vaccine_resp). On each visit, samples were analyzed and information about which assays were performed (assay field) and value of the measured analytes (units and data) are stored in the <strong><em>experimental_data</em></strong> table. Finally, the <strong><em>medical_history</em></strong> table describes information connected with each clinical visit about the usage of statins (statin_use) and if influenza vaccine was received in the past (influenza vaccine history), if yes, how many times (total_vaccines_received). Also, we provide information on which type of influenza vaccine was received in the previous years (1 to 5 years prior to enrolment in the clinical study). Lastly, information about influenza infection history and influenza-related hospitalization is provided.</p>  <p><strong>How to cite FluPRINT?</strong></p>  <p><em>If you use FluPRINT in an academic publication, please use the following citation:&nbsp;</em></p>  <p>Tomic, A., Tomic, I., Dekker, C.L. <em>et al.</em> The FluPRINT dataset, a multidimensional analysis of the influenza vaccine imprint on the immune system. <em>Sci Data</em> <strong>6, </strong>214 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0213-4</p>  <p><strong>Contact Information</strong></p>  <p>If you are interested to find out more about the FluPRINT, or if you experience any problems with downloading files, please contact us at <a href=""mailto:info@adrianatomic.com"">info@adrianatomic.com</a>.</p>",Mucosal vaccines — fortifying the frontiers,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-021-00583-2,640,pdfs/Mucosal_vaccines___fortifying_the_frontiers.pdf

The first dimension corresponds to the different exams; the second dimension corresponds to the 4096 signal samples; the third dimension to the 12 different leads of the ECG exams in the following order: `{DI, DII, DIII, AVR, AVL, AVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6}`. The signals are sampled at 400 Hz. Some signals originally have a duration of 10 seconds (10 * 400 = 4000 samples) and others of 7 seconds (7 * 400 = 2800 samples). In order to make them all have the same size (4096 samples), we fill them with zeros on both sizes. For instance, for a 7 seconds ECG signal with 2800 samples we include 648 samples at the beginning and 648 samples at the end, yielding 4096 samples that are then saved in the hdf5 dataset.&nbsp; <p>In python, one can read this file using <a href=""https://www.h5py.org/"">h5py</a>.<br>```python<br>import h5py</p> <p>f = h5py.File(path_to_file, 'r')<br># Get ids<br>traces_ids = np.array(self.f['id_exam'])<br>x = f['signal']<br>```<br>The `signal` dataset is too large to fit in memory, so don't convert it to a numpy array all at once.<br>It is possible to access a chunk of it using: ``x[start:end, :, :]``.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The CODE dataset&nbsp;was collected by&nbsp;the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) in the period&nbsp;between 2010 and 2016.

Nonhuman Primate Reaching with Multichannel Sensorimotor Cortex Electrophysiology,3854034,"<p><strong>General Description.</strong> This&nbsp;dataset consists of:</p> <ol> <li>The threshold crossing times of extracellularly and simultaneously&nbsp;recorded spikes, sorted into units (up to five, including a ""hash"" unit), along with sorted waveform snippets, and,</li> <li>The x,y position of the fingertip of the reaching hand and the x,y position of reaching targets (both sampled at 250 Hz).</li> </ol> <p>The behavioral task was to make self-paced reaches to targets arranged in a grid (e.g. 8x8) without gaps or pre-movement delay intervals. One monkey reached with the right arm (recordings made in the left hemisphere); The other reached with the left arm (right hemisphere). In some sessions recordings were made from both M1 and S1 arrays (192 channels); in most sessions M1 recordings were made alone (96 channels).</p> <p>Data from two primate subjects are included: 37 sessions from monkey 1 (""Indy"",&nbsp;spanning about 10 months) and 10 sessions from monkey 2 (""Loco"",&nbsp;spanning about 1 month), for a total of ~ 20,000 reaches and 6,500 reaches from monkeys 1 and 2, respectively.</p> <p><strong>Possible uses.&nbsp;</strong>These data are ideal for training BCI decoders, in particular because they are not segmented into trials.&nbsp;We expect that the dataset will be valuable for researchers who wish to design improved models of sensorimotor cortical spiking&nbsp;or provide an equal footing for comparing&nbsp;different BCI decoders. Other uses could include analyses of the statistics of arm kinematics, spike noise-correlations or signal-correlations, or for exploring the stability or variability of extracellular recording over sessions.</p> <p><strong>Variable names. </strong>Each file contains data in the following format.

Dataset for Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease Diagnostics Using X-Ray Angiography Images,10390295,"<p>ARCADE: Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease diagnostics using x-ray angiography imagEs Dataset Phase 2 consist of two folders with 300 images in each of them as well as annotations.&nbsp;</p> <p>ARCADE: Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease diagnostics using x-ray angiography imagEs Dataset Phase 1 consists of two datasets of XCA images for each of two tasks of ARCADE challenge.&nbsp;The first task includes in total 1200 coronary vessel tree images, which are divided into train(1000) and validation(200) groups, images for training are followed with annotations,&nbsp;depicting the division of a heart into 26 different regions based on the Syntax Score methodology[1]. Similarly, the second task includes a different set of 1200 images with same train-val division proportion&nbsp;with annotated regions containing atherosclerotic plaques. This dataset, carefully annotated by medical experts, enables scientists to actively contribute towards the advancement of an automated risk assessment system for patients with CAD.&nbsp;</p> <p>The dataset structure is as follows: top-level directories ""syntax"" and ""stenosis"" contain files for the two dataset objectives, namely: i) vessel branch classification according to the SYNTAX methodology; and ii) stenosis detection. Inside both directories, there are 3 subsets of the dataset, such as ""train"", ""val"", and ""test"". Inside each of those folders, there are 2 lower-level directories - ""images"", and ""annotations"". Inside the ""images"" folder there are images in "".png"" format, extracted from DICOM recordings. The ""annotations"" folders contain single "".JSON"" files, which are named in correspondence to the objective, i.e. ""train.JSON"", ""val.JSON"", and ""test.JSON"".</p> <p>The structure of "".JSON"" contains three top-level fields: ""images"", ""categories"", and ""annotations"". The ""images"" field contains the unique ""id"" of the image in the dataset, its ""width"" and ""height"" in pixels, and the ""file_name"" sub-field, which contains specific information about the image. The ""categories"" field contains a unique ""id"" from 1 to 26, and a ""name"", relating it to the SYNTAX descriptions. The ""annotations"" field contains a unique ""id"" of the annotation, ""image_id"" value, relating it to the specific image from the ""images"" field, and a ""category_id"" relating it to the specific category from the ""categories"" field. The ""segmentation"" sub-field contains coordinates of mask edge points in ""XYXY"" format. Bounding box coordinates are given in the ""bbox"" field in the ""XYWH"" format, where the first 2 values represent the x and y coordinates of the left-most and top-most points in the segmentation mask. The height and width of the bounding box are determined by the difference between the right-most and bottom-most points and the first two values. Finally, the ""area"" field provides the total area of the bounding box, calculated as the area of a rectangle.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The corresponding Dataset Article will be provided later.&nbsp;</p> <p>[1]&nbsp;Syntax score segment definitions. https://syntaxscore.org/index.php/tutorial/definitions/14-appendix-i-segment-definitions</p>",Dataset for Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease Diagnostics Using X-Ray Angiography Images,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02871-z,52,pdfs/Dataset_for_Automatic_Region-based_Coronary_Artery_Disease_Diagnostics_Using_X-R.pdf
MicrobiomeHD: the human gut microbiome in health and disease,1146764,"<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>  <p>MicrobiomeHD is a standardized database of human gut microbiome studies in health and disease. This database includes publicly available 16S data from published case-control studies and their associated patient metadata. Raw sequencing data for each study was downloaded and processed through a standardized pipeline.</p>  <p>To be included in MicrobiomeHD, datasets have:</p>  <ul> 	<li>publicly available raw sequencing data (fastq or fasta)</li> 	<li>publicly available metadata with at least case and control labels for each patient</li> </ul>  <p>Currently, MicrobiomeHD is focused on stool samples. Additional samples may be included in certain datasets, as indicated in the metadata.</p>  <p><strong>Files</strong></p>  <p>Additional information about the datasets included in this MicrobiomeHD release are in the MicrobiomeHD github repo <a href=""https://github.com/cduvallet/microbiomeHD"">https://github.com/cduvallet/microbiomeHD</a>, in the file <em>db/dataset_info.yaml</em>. Top-level identifiers correspond to dataset IDs labeled by disease_first-author. For the most part, sample sizes in the yaml file are those that were described in the papers, and may not exactly reflect the actual data (due to missing/extra data, samples which didn&#39;t pass quality control, etc).</p>  <p>Each dataset was downloaded and processed through a standardized pipeline. The raw processing results are available in the *.tar.gz files here. Each file has the same directory structure and files, as described in the pipeline documentation: <a href=""http://amplicon-sequencing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html"">http://amplicon-sequencing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html</a>.</p>  <p>Specific files of interest in each *.tar.gz folder include:</p>  <ul> 	<li><strong>summary_file.txt</strong>: this file contains a summary of all parameters used to process the data</li> 	<li><strong>datasetID.metadata.txt</strong>: the metadata associated with the samples. Note that some samples in the metadata may not have sequencing data, and vice versa.</li> 	<li><strong>RDP/datasetID.otu_table.100.denovo.rdp_assigned</strong>: the 100% OTU tables with Latin taxonomic names assigned using the RDP classifier (c = 0.5).</li> 	<li><strong>datasetID.otu_seqs.100.fasta</strong>: representative sequences for each OTU in the 100% OTU table. OTU labels in the OTU table end with <code>d__denovoID</code> - these denovoIDs correspond to the sequences in this file.</li> 	<li><strong>README.txt</strong>: additional information about steps taken to download and process each dataset, as needed.</li> </ul>  <p>The raw data was acquired as described in the supplementary materials of Duvallet et al.&#39;s &quot;Meta analysis of microbiome studies identifies shared and disease-specific patterns&quot; and, when available, the respective dataset README files.</p>  <p>Raw sequencing data was processed with the Alm lab&#39;s in-house 16S processing pipeline: <a href=""https://github.com/thomasgurry/amplicon_sequencing_pipeline"">https://github.com/thomasgurry/amplicon_sequencing_pipeline</a></p>  <p>Pipeline documentation is available at: <a href=""http://amplicon-sequencing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/"">http://amplicon-sequencing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/</a></p>  <p>Metadata was extracted from the original papers and/or data sources, and formatted manually. When possible, these steps are documented in each dataset&#39;s associated README.txt file.</p>  <p><strong>Contributing</strong></p>  <p>MicrobiomeHD is a resource that can be used to extract disease-specific microbiome signals in individual case-control studies.

Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset,7711412,"<p>This dataset was acquired in a retrospective study from a cohort of pediatric patients admitted with abdominal pain to Children&rsquo;s Hospital St. Hedwig in Regensburg, Germany. Multiple abdominal B-mode ultrasound images were acquired for most patients, with the number of views varying from 1 to 15. The images depict various regions of interest, such as the abdomen&rsquo;s right lower quadrant, appendix, intestines, lymph nodes and reproductive organs. Alongside multiple US images for each subject, the dataset includes information encompassing laboratory tests, physical examination results, clinical scores, such as Alvarado and pediatric appendicitis scores, and expert-produced ultrasonographic findings. Lastly, the subjects were labeled w.r.t. three target variables: diagnosis (appendicitis vs. no appendicitis), management (surgical vs. conservative) and severity (complicated vs. uncomplicated or no appendicitis).&nbsp;The&nbsp;study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Regensburg (no. 18-1063-101, 18-1063_1-101 and 18-1063_2-101)&nbsp;and was performed following applicable guidelines and regulations.</p>",An interpretable and transparent machine learning framework for appendicitis detection in pediatric patients,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75896-y,9,pdfs/An_interpretable_and_transparent_machine_learning_framework_for_appendicitis_det.pdf
Machine Learning Dataset for Poultry Diseases Diagnostics - PCR annotated,5801834,"<p>The dataset of poultry disease diagnostics was annotated using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a molecular biology technique for rapid diagnostics. We gathered both the fecal images and fecal samples from layers, cross and indigenous breeds of chicken from poultry farms in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions in Tanzania between September 2020 and February 2021. Each fecal sample collected was coded to its corresponding image during data collection. PCR method is used for detection and identification of pathogens through amplification of DNA sequences unique to the pathogen. We used existing primers from literature to amplify the target DNA/RNA on the poultry fecal samples for PCR. The targets were Coccidiosis, Newcastle disease and Salmonella. We used the primers for PCR diagnostics at the molecular laboratory of the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST). The fecal samples were stored at -80 degrees celsius. The PCR diagnostics were conducted using reagents and kits from Zymo Research and the protocol is summarized in these five stages: 1. DNA sample loading 2. DNA extraction 3. Amplification; 4. Quantification and 5. Detection.</p>  <p>All the PCR annotated fecal images are in the <strong><strong>.zip files</strong></strong>; &ldquo;pcrcocci.zip&rdquo; has 373 images, &ldquo;pcrhealthy.zip&rdquo; has 347 images, &ldquo;pcrsalmo.zip&rdquo; has 349 images, &quot;pcrncd.zip&quot; has 186 images.

The open D1NAMO dataset: A multi-modal dataset for research on non-invasive type 1 diabetes management,5651217,"<p>The description of the dataset is available at <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2018.09.003"">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2018.09.003</a></p>  <p>The usage of wearable devices has gained popularity in the latest years, especially for health-care and well being. Recently there has been an increasing interest in using these devices to improve the management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. The quality of data acquired through&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/wearable-sensor"">wearable sensors</a>&nbsp;is generally lower than what medical-grade devices provide, and existing datasets have mainly been acquired in highly controlled clinical conditions. In the context of the&nbsp;<em>D1NAMO</em>&nbsp;project &mdash; aiming to detect&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/glycemic"">glycemic</a>&nbsp;events through non-invasive&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/ecg-abnormality"">ECG pattern</a>&nbsp;analysis &mdash; we elaborated a dataset that can be used to help developing health-care systems based on wearable devices in non-clinical conditions. This paper describes this dataset, which was acquired on 20 healthy subjects and 9 patients with type-1 diabetes. The acquisition has been made in real-life conditions with the&nbsp;<em>Zephyr BioHarness 3</em>&nbsp;wearable device. The dataset consists of&nbsp;<em>ECG</em>,&nbsp;<em>breathing</em>, and&nbsp;<em><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/accelerometer"">accelerometer</a></em>&nbsp;signals, as well as&nbsp;<em>glucose</em>&nbsp;measurements and annotated&nbsp;<em>food pictures</em>. We open this dataset to the scientific community in order to allow the development and evaluation of diabetes management algorithms.</p>",A Consent Model for Blockchain-Based Health Data Sharing Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3014565,118,
DADA2 formatted 16S rRNA gene sequences for both bacteria \& archaea,13984843,"<p><strong><em>This version is to stay up to date with the improvements and increase in 16S rRNA gene sequences (SSU) added to the GTDB release 220.&nbsp; Please read this post for the stats on the updates. </em></strong><strong><em>https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/stats/r220 </em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>There has been no change to the RDP-RefSeq reference database please use previous versions.</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>If anyone has concerns&nbsp;with MAG extracted 16S rRNA gene contamination concerns, then I suggest that they contact the curators of GTDB themselves because it is outside of my role with these resources designed for DADA2 usage only. </em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>Another concern that was raised was the orientation of the DB sequences, to get past this problem please use the tryRC = TRUE argument in the assignTaxonomy command within DADA2, this will search your ASVs in the reverse complement as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p>The bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence databases were collated from various sources and formatted to use the ""assignTaxonomy"" command within the DADA2 pipeline. The data was converted to suite DADA2 format by Alishum Ali.</p> <ol> <li>Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB): The new version of our dada2 formatted GTDB reference sequences now contains 58102 bacteria and 3672 archaea full 16S rRNA gene sequences. If you wonder why there are fewer species with 16S rRNA, that is because some metagenomics-assembled genomes (MAGs) lack the 16S gene and thus cannot be extracted.&nbsp; The database was downloaded from <a href=""https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/release95/"">https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/</a> on 24/10/2024. Please read the release notes and file descriptions.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <p>The formatting to DADA2 was done using simple awk bash scripts. The script takes as input a fasta file and a tab-delimited taxonomy file (slightly edited to remove special characters) and then it outputs a fasta file with all 7 taxonomy ranks separated by "";"" as required for DADA2 compatibility. Additionally, we have concatenated the unique sequence GTDB ID to the species entry (but replaced the ""."" with an "" _"". We see this as an important QC step to highlight the issues/confidence associated with short-read taxonomy assignment at the finer rank levels.</p> <p>Also, this update includes two other files that you can use with the assignTaxonomy and addSpecies commands in DADA2.</p>",Effectiveness of biochar application and bioaugmentation techniques for the remediation of freshly and aged diesel-polluted soils,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2021.105259,23,
