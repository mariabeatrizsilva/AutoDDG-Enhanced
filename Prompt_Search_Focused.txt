        You are given a dataset about the topic {topic}, with the following initial description: {initial_descriptionription}.

        Please expand the description by including the exact topic. Additionally, add as many related concepts, synonyms, and relevant terms 
        as possible based on the initial description and the topic.

        Unlike the initial description, which is focused on presentation and readability, the expanded description is intended to be indexed 
        at backend of a dataset search engine to improve searchability.

        Therefore, focus less on readability and more on including all relevant terms related to the topic. Make sure to include any variations 
        of the key terms and concepts that could help improve retrieval in search results.

        Please follow the structure of following example template:
