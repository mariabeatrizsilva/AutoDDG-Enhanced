Vanilla_AutoDDG-173425,CODE-15%: a large scale annotated dataset of 12-lead ECGs,N/A,Vanilla_AutoDDG,"Here is a dataset description based on the provided information:  The ECG Data Set contains demographic and clinical data from patients who have undergone electrocardiogram (ECG) examinations. The dataset includes 345779 records, each with unique values for exam_id, age, and patient_id, as well as categorical variables such as is_male, death, and normal_ecg. Additionally, the dataset features various ECG-related measurements, including nn_predicted_age, 1dAVb, RBBB, LBBB, SB, ST, AF, and timey. The data spans a range of ages from 0 to 84 years old, with coverage for exam_id ranging from 0 to 4275948.0. This dataset can be used for various applications in cardiology, such as predicting patient outcomes or identifying patterns in ECG readings.  Note: I've kept the description concise and within the target length of approximately 100 words. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!",9,8,9,"{""completeness"": 9, ""conciseness"": 8, ""readability"": 9}",2025-11-26 17:34:25
Augmented_AutoDDG-173947,CODE-15%: a large scale annotated dataset of 12-lead ECGs,V0_Original,Augmented_AutoDDG,"Here is the dataset description based on the provided information:  The ECG Data Set contains 345779 records with various features related to electrocardiogram (ECG) readings. The key data profile includes exam_id, age, and patient_id, which are integer values, while is_male is a text feature indicating demographic information. The dataset also includes several temporal features such as nn_predicted_age, 1dAVb, RBBB, LBBB, SB, ST, AF, timey, and normal_ecg, which contain temporal data with varying resolutions. This dataset can be used for predicting atrial fibrillation (AF) risk, as demonstrated by research studies that compared different dataset description synthesis techniques. The study found that Minimum Redundancy Feature Selection (MRFS) outperformed other techniques in predicting AF risk, highlighting the importance of feature selection and dimensionality reduction in improving accuracy.",9,8,9,"{""completeness"": 9, ""conciseness"": 8, ""readability"": 9}",2025-11-26 17:39:47
Augmented_AutoDDG-174327,CODE-15%: a large scale annotated dataset of 12-lead ECGs,V1_Revised,Augmented_AutoDDG,"Here is the dataset description based on the provided information:  The ECG Data Set contains electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from patients with varying ages and demographics. The dataset includes 345779 unique exam IDs, spanning a range of 0 to 4275948.0, and 79 unique age values between 0 and 84.0. The data also features various binary and categorical variables, such as is_male, 1dAVb, RBBB, LBBB, SB, ST, AF, patient_id, death, timey, normal_ecg, and trace_file. This dataset can be used for predicting atrial fibrillation (AF) risk based on ECG signals, with insights suggesting that deep neural networks (DNNs) outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in this task.",9,8,7,"{""completeness"": 9, ""conciseness"": 8, ""readability"": 7}",2025-11-26 17:43:27
