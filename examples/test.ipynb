      "CODE-15% is a large-scale annotated dataset of 12-lead ECGs, derived from the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) dataset. It contains 7–10-second-long recordings resampled to 400 Hz, with a focus on cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis, atrial fibrillation (AF) risk prediction, and age estimation. The dataset includes 6 arrhythmia classes (first-degree atrioventricular block, right and left bundle branch block, sinus bradycardia, AF, and sinus tachycardia) and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) as a control. For AF risk prediction, recordings were classified as \"Future AF\" (patients with subsequent AF diagnosis within 5 years) or \"Non-AF\" (patients without AF in any subsequent recordings within 5 years). The age estimation task used single recordings per patient aged 16-85, with the test set following the work of Lima et al. (2021). The dataset was used to train and evaluate three models: a random forest (RF) model using feature engineering (FE), an end-to-end deep learning (DL) model, and a merged FE+DL model. The authors found that FE yielded comparable results to DL for the classification tasks (arrhythmia diagnosis and AF risk prediction) while necessitating significantly less data. However, DL outperformed FE for the regression task (age estimation). The merged FE+DL model did not improve performance over DL alone, suggesting that the FE features were redundant with those learned by DL. The dataset was also used to verify the consistency of the experimental results on the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt Extra Large (PTB-XL) dataset, confirming the superiority of DL for the age estimation task. The authors conclude that for traditional 12-lead ECG-based diagnosis tasks, DL did not yield a meaningful improvement over FE, while it improved significantly for the nontraditional regression task. They also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over DL alone, which suggests that the FE was redundant with the features learned by DL.\n"
